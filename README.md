# -Tinder-Review-Sentiment-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project leverages **Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML)** to analyze user sentiment in **Tinder reviews** from Google Play. By classifying reviews into **positive, negative, and neutral sentiments**, we extract valuable insights into user experiences, common complaints, and feature requests. Additionally, we apply **topic modeling** to uncover recurring themes in user feedback, providing actionable recommendations for improving the platform.

## Methodology

### 1 Data Preprocessing
- **Tokenization:** Breaking text into individual words for analysis.
- **Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging:** Identifying adjectives, nouns, and verbs.
- **Lemmatization:** Reducing words to their base form for consistency.
- **Stopword Removal:** Eliminating common words that do not add meaning.
- **Adjective Extraction:** Identifying key descriptive words used in reviews.
- **Word Frequency Analysis:** Identifying the most frequently used adjectives to determine common themes.

### 2 Sentiment Classification
We used two ML models to classify user sentiment:
- **Na√Øve Bayes (TF-IDF & CountVectorizer)**: Achieved **84.29% accuracy** with TF-IDF.
- **KNN with Cosine Similarity**: Achieved **82.7% accuracy** with k = 15.
- **Final Choice:** Na√Øve Bayes (TF-IDF) due to its higher accuracy and efficiency.

### 3 Topic Modeling (LDA - Latent Dirichlet Allocation)
We extracted key topics from reviews by training LDA models with **5 and 6 topics**. Major identified themes included:
- **Fake Profiles & Bots**
- **Subscription & Pricing Concerns** 
- **Account Bans & Moderation Issues** 
- **User Engagement & Matching Algorithm** 
- **Technical Glitches & Performance Problems** 

## Results & Insights
- **User dissatisfaction is primarily driven by fake profiles and pricing concerns.**
- **Subscription complaints are frequent, suggesting a need for clearer pricing and billing policies.**
- **Moderation and account bans frustrate users, indicating possible transparency improvements.**
- **Positive feedback highlights good matches and user experience but is outweighed by concerns.**
- **LDA topic modeling helped identify key problem areas for app improvement.**

## Business, Economic & Societal Impact
### Business Impact
- **Enhancing user retention & trust** by addressing core complaints.
- **Optimizing pricing strategies** based on user sentiment.
- **Improving AI-driven moderation** to detect fake profiles.

### Economic Impact
- **Increased revenue potential** by reducing churn and improving premium subscriptions.
- **Lower customer acquisition costs** by resolving common user frustrations.

### Societal Impact
- **Improved user safety** through better moderation.
- **Increased inclusivity & accessibility** through feature improvements.
- **Better customer service** to resolve billing and account issues.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack & Libraries
